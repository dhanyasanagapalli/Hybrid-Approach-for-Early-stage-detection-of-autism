## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **early-stage detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using **machine learning techniques**.  
It provides a **complete end-to-end Python-based pipeline** including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and **real-time prediction** through a **Streamlit web application**.

The system compares multiple ML models to determine the most effective approach for ASD screening.
