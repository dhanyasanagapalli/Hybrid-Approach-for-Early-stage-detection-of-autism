project:
  🏷️ title: "Early Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder"
  🧪 subtitle: "Machine Learning Based Screening Tool"

  📝 description: >
    This project focuses on the early-stage detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
    using machine learning techniques. It implements a complete end-to-end Python-based
    workflow including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation,
    failure analysis, and deployment through a Streamlit-based interactive web application.
    
    Multiple machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest,
    XGBoost, and CatBoost were trained and compared. Model performance was analyzed using
    standard evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and
    Confusion Matrix to identify the best-performing model.
